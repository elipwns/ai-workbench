# GPU Support Notes

## Current Status: CPU-Only

The system currently uses CPU for all ML processing due to RTX 5090 compatibility issues.

## RTX 5090 Compatibility
- **Issue**: RTX 5090 uses sm_120 architecture not yet supported by stable PyTorch
- **Error**: "CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device"
- **Status**: Waiting for PyTorch to add sm_120 support

## Future GPU Acceleration
When RTX 5090 is supported:
- Sentiment analysis: Could use GPU-accelerated transformers
- Price prediction: Neural networks would benefit from GPU training
- Expected speedup: 10-50x for large model training

## Current Performance
- **Sentiment Analysis**: 55+ texts/second on CPU
- **ML Training**: Sufficient for current dataset sizes
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB RAM during processing

*Note: GPU support will be added when PyTorch officially supports RTX 5090*
